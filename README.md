## Welcome
I am a Senior Research Scientist at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, working on data management and retrieval, data augmentation related problems in the context of LLMs, and solving challenges related to LLM discovery and evaluations at large scale.

I completed my Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/index.php), [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2022, advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/index.html) and [Prof. Manikandan Narayanan](https://maninarayanan.com/index.html). My thesis on "Algorithms For Rich Graph Structures" won the Best Ph.D. Thesis in Data Science award at IIT Madras.
